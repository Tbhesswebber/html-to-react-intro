# html-to-react-intro

A brief introduction repo for developers who know HTML/CSS and moving them into presentational React components with React and Styled Components

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo into your own Github account
2. Clone the repo down to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/ **YOUR HANDLE HERE** /html-to-react-intro.git
cd html-to-react-intro
```

3. From the root folder run `code .` or `subl .` to open the code base in your editor of choice.
4. From your terminal inside that folder, run:

- `npm install` // installs all dependencies
- `npm run react-dev` // runs the development build for webpack and serves it up with webpack-dev-server at localhost:1182. This should automatically open a new browser window, but if not, open a browser to localhost:1182 to see the app.

5. If you have never used React before, make sure you have Babel/Javascript/React syntax highlighting set up. You can do this by going to your command palette (⌘ + ⇧ + p) then searching for 'react' or 'babel' or 'syntax highlighting'. Click on the option and make sure it is enabled for all files with a '.jsx' extension.
6. Check out the homepage at localhost:1182 for more instructions on using this repo and learning React/JSX!
