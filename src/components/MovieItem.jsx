/** *************************************************
 * This will be the initial playground for getting comfortable with
 * React/JSX syntax, after exploring the codebase a bit...
 *
 * This code is partially written, and if you followed the steps to
 * start the app locally, and go to http://localhost:1182/#/movies
 * You should see that there is some basic styling, but not very polished.
 *
 * Go ahead and play around with styled components, create new ones,
 * adjust the ones already written. Use more of the data if you want...
 * ANYTHING is possible, just play around and get used to it.
 *
 * When you are finished, move onto the 'User' component, which
 * is almost completely empty to really get into the code.
